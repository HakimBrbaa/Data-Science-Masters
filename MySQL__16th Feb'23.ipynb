    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that makes it easy to manage and access. It is designed to provide a way to store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two types of databases that differ in the way they store and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. SQL databases are characterized by their ability to handle complex queries, transactions, and structured data. They are widely used in applications that require complex transactions and well-defined data relationships. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible and dynamic way. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they are often used in applications that require high scalability and performance. NoSQL databases come in many different types, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family databases. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use a variety of data models (e.g., document-oriented, key-value, graph).\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use the SQL query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages (or APIs) depending on the data model.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally considered more scalable than SQL databases, and can handle larger volumes of data and more concurrent users. However, SQL databases are often better suited for complex transactions and well-defined data relationships."

    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "- TRUNCATE: This statement is used to remove all data from a table. It is different from the DROP statement because it preserves the table structure and only deletes the data. For example, to remove all data from the \"customers\" table, you can use the following SQL statement:\n",

    "Primary key and foreign key are two important concepts in database design. A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some more details on each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys are used to ensure that each row in a table is unique and to allow other tables to refer to this table using foreign keys. Primary keys can be made up of one or more columns, and they must have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique: Each row in the table must have a unique value for the primary key.\n",
    "- Non-null: The primary key value cannot be null.\n",
    "- Stable: The value of the primary key should not change over time.\n",
    "For example, in a \"customers\" table, the \"customer_id\" column could be the primary key. Each customer would have a unique ID, and this ID would not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables, allowing you to link data from different tables. A foreign key must reference a primary key, and it must have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Referential integrity: The values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column.\n",
    "- Non-null: The value in the foreign key column cannot be null.\n",
    "For example, in an \"orders\" table, there might be a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that references the primary key of the \"customers\" table. This allows you to link each order to the customer who placed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys are used to ensure that each row in a table is unique, while foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables by linking to the primary key of another table. By using primary keys and foreign keys, you can create a well-organized database that can efficiently store and retrieve data."
